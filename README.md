This repo is the supporting material for two blog posts:

- [Consuming APIs in Angular: The Model-Adapter Pattern]
- [Consuming APIs in Angular: Display Data In Components]

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## Install

For the Angular app, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

The backend server requires Python 3.6+. Its only dependency is [Bocadillo], which can be installed using:

```bash
pip install bocadillo
```

## Quick start

First, fire up the backend server:

```bash
python app.py
```

It will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can then start the Angular dev server using:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see the result. ðŸŽŠ
